            <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
            <p>The digital divide is a growing concern in our increasingly connected world. Many individuals and communities face significant barriers to accessing the internet due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited or no internet infrastructure in rural or low-income areas</li>
                <li>High costs of internet services and devices</li>
                <li>Bandwidth bottlenecks caused by increasing video traffic</li>
                <li>Limited access to educational resources and healthcare information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These issues create disparities in education, healthcare access, economic opportunities, and civic participation.</p>
